# Contributing to Microsoft Worldwide Learning Repositories

Trainer and learner contributions are a key part of keeping the lab and demo content current as the Azure platform changes. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute changes to the exercise files. You can help improve the content by:

- Submitting an **Issue** describing a specific problem you have encountered. The content owner for this repo will investigate and resolve your issue.
- Submitting a **Pull Request** that includes your changes to the files in this repo. Your PR will be reviewed by the content owner for this repo and, if accepted, merged into the main branch.

## Additional Resources

A user guide has been provided for MCTs who are new to GitHub. It provides steps for connecting to GitHub, downloading and printing course materials, updating the scripts that students use in exercises, and explaining how you can help ensure that this hands-on content remains current.
